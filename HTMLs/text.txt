Excuse me, do you have a map? I keep getting lost in your eyes.
Are you a magician? Every time I look at you, everyone else disappears.
Do you have a Band-Aid? I just scraped my knee falling for you.
I must be a snowflake because I've fallen for you.
Can I follow you home? Because my parents always told me to follow my dreams.
